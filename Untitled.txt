**some notes that are committed from this txt file will most likely comments placed around the files

From the Hello world component of this project under ui.apps, the content.xml for the cq:dialog contains data that are defined to be able to define the properties of this 'hello world' component in the form of a node. Example snippet from the content.xml holds information about how a particular property is defined for a node:

		       <title
                        	jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
                        	sling:resourceType="granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/form/textfield"
                        	fieldLabel="Title"
                        	name="./title"
		       />

                        <!-- the name propety is name of what this property will be saved as.
                        the label for the fieldLabel is set by value of the path from sling:resourceType
                        and the sling:resourceType defines what the component will render as. in this case, a text field
		       plus the property is tagged as title-->



In the HTML file of the component -- the HTL/sightyl:
the ${}, the HTL expression language, indicates dynamic code that the HTML will be recognized and interpreted by the HTL compiler
'properties' is the SHORT-HAND OBEJCT that REFERENCES ANY OF THE PROPERTIES SAVED BY THE COMPONENT


Core components are OPEN SOURCED and are good to reference from them as they lay out the foundation of a component an author/developer might want to inherit from.


Sling Models --> annotation driven POJOS that facilitate the MAPPING OF DATA/PROPERTIES FROM THE JCR TO JAVA VARIABLES, and provide a number of custom/intractable ways of developing in the context of AEM.
Any complex business logic that a component might require, SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN A SLING MODEL, ensuring the the component's HTL script remains simple and promotes a clean "SEPARATION OF CONCERNS"
*look at the HelloWorld java class under the /core/...models and the HTL scripts

data-sly-use -->						HTL block statement that initializes a helper object (ie the path/properties/source)
.model -->						variable used to EXPOSE the helper object
="com.adobe.aem.sample.core.models.HelloWorldModel" -->	the initialized helper object, and that the *file name must be used, for this
							example,it'a also the sling model for the component.


*typical convention that there one sling model for every AEM component

When using the ValueMapValue --> it is by convention where the java variable text MATCHES the JCR property text
Once changes have been in the OSGI --- JAVA, then accordingly, changes will/will not have to be made in the HTL
	*after the changing the HelloWorld sling model, the HTL has some changes that will REFERENCE THE java model to display the changes from the
	back-end



data-sly-test --> a short hand if-statement by HTL, where if the value is NULL or BLANK, it's host element will not be rendered.
For example: data-sly-test="${model.text}" if the value of the text is NULL when it is returned from the sling model, the block statement will NOT render.
