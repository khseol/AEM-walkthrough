they're in the container-->

    <!--the ${} indicates dynamic code that the HTML will be recognized and interpreted by the HTL compiler
    'properties' is the SHORT-HAND OBEJCT that REFERENCES ANY OF THE PROPERTIES SAVED BY THE COMPONENT-->

    <!--properties.title was hanged to model.title BECAUSE we are referencing the sling model,
        that was referenced the HTL block statement on line 19, where 'model' is the variable
        used to expose the content from the back-end; and 'title' is a reference to the 'getTitle'
        method in the sling model. The convention to reference a getter is to remove 'get' and make the next word
        lowercase.

        Doing it this way is a much more prefferebale way to access content
        rather than accessing component's property.-->
